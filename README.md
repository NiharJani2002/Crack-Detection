# Crack-Detection
The provided Python code defines a CrackDetection class, which offers a comprehensive pipeline for detecting cracks in images. The code imports necessary libraries for image processing, including NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, PIL, and tkinter for creating a graphical user interface. The class contains methods for converting images to grayscale, applying Gaussian filtering, computing gradient magnitudes and directions, non-maximum suppression, thresholding, and edge tracking.

The detect_cracks_on_image method utilizes a GUI to allow users to select an image file. It then processes the selected RGB image, applies a sequence of image processing steps, and displays both intermediate and final results in a graphical interface. This code serves as a foundation for crack detection in images, making it accessible and visually informative for users.
